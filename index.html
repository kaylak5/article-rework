<p>From frienships to salary negotiations, 2020 can be the year you
conquer work and your career. Taking hold of your future begins
with standing up for yourself, while also learning to navigate the
complicated world of office politics. The murky frienships and
bureaucracy can at times be maddening, but persevering does not
only mean climbing the corporate ladder. It could also mean
defining your own path.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/07/smarter-living/how-to-be-happier-at-work.html">Find more happiness at work</a></h2>
  <body>
  <p>As many as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/guides/year-of-living-better/how-to-create-a-better-work-environment">third of United States workers</a> say they don't feel
      engaged at work. The reasons vary widely, and everyone's
      relationship wtih work is unique. But there are small ways to
      improve any job, and those incremental improvements can add up
      to major increases in job satisfaction.</p>
      <p>In fact, one study found that changing even just a small portion of
  what makes up your job can have a major impact on your overall
  happiness. In other words: You don't need to change everything
  about your job to see substantial benefits. A few changes here and
  there can be all you need. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/07/smarter-living/how-to-be-happier-at-work.html">Read more</a>

  <body>
    In the past two decades, a movement to play to our strengths has
    gained momentum in the world of work. It's a travesty that many
    people are fixated solely on repairing their weaknesses and don't
    have the chance to do what they do best every day. But it's a
    problem that many people aren't thoughtful about when to do what
    they do best. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/26/smarter-living/how-your-strengths-can-make-you-weaker.html">Read more</a>

      </body>
      When things go right, we're generally pretty good at identifying
      why they went right - that is, if we even take time to analyze the
      success at all. Preparation, properr scheduling, smart delegation
      and so on. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. But falling on our face gives
      us the rare opportunity to find and address the things that went
      wrong (or, even more broadly, the traits or habits that led us to
      fail), and it's an opporunity we should welcome. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/smarter-living/failure-resume.html">Read more</a>

  </body>
  Gossip at work is common, as is the desire to be a part of a group.
  In a new work environment, this combination can be harmful if you
  fall in with collegues who are <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/05/the-next-time-you-want-to-complain-at-work-do-this-instead">know for being negative and
  wasting productive time.</a>

  While <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/04/how-complaining-turns-co-workers-into-friends.html">complaining with co-workers</a> can turn some of these
  colleagues into friends, <a href="http://www.jilljacinto.com/">Jill Jacinto,</a> a millennial career expert, said
  it's best to avoid gossip altogether.

  "If someone asks, 'What do you think of Mark? Have you worked
  with him yet?'just focus on the professional," she said. "'He's great
  to work with. He seems to know technology really well.'" <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/smarter-living/how-to-answer-tricky-personal-questions-at-a-new-job.html">Read

  <h2><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/01/smarter-living/thinking-about-a-job-or-career-change-read-this.html">Ask yourself: Are you doing what you want to be
  doing?</a></h2>
  </body>
  Maybe you are! Or maybe you're not?? Who knows! It's one of the
  toughest questions we'll grapple with in our lives.

  But when was the last time you were completely honest with
  yourself and thought about it? If you're like most people, probably
  not recently.

  "I'm a big believer in evaluating where you think you are in your
  life about once a year," said Art Markman, professor of psychology
  and marketing at the University of Texas at Austin, and author of
  the book "<a href="http://www.smartthinkingbook.com/p/bring-your-brain.html">Bring Your Brain to Work.</a>"

  He added: "Don't wait for a tragedy to strike before you're willing
  to actually think about this." <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/01/smarter-living/thinking-about-a-job-or-career-change-read-this.html">Read more</a>

  <body>
    At some point in your work life, you've probably had to interact
    with a jerk. They're the people who demean and disrespect you.
    They might steal credit for your successes, blame you for their
    failures, invade your privacy or break their promises, or bad-
    mouth you, scream at you and belittle you. As the organizational
    psychologist Bob Sutton <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Asshole-Survival-Guide-People-Treat/dp/1328695913">puts it,</a> they treat you like dirt, and either
    they don't know it or they don't care. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/smarter-living/how-to-deal-with-a-jerk-without-being-a-jerk.html">Read more</a>

    <body>
      It's a request that experienced people of any industry have gotten
      at some point: "Can I buy you coffee and pick your brain?" While
      well-intentioned, execution is everything, and sometimes these
      unsolicited requests for a casual, informational interviews can
      come off as entitled and presumptuous. And for the receiver, it can
      be difficult or even unrealistic for a busy professional to coordinate
      bespoke consultation appointments for everyone who asks. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/smarter-living/the-right-way-to-ask-can-i-pick-your-brain.html">Read

        to express ourselves clearly, or that we won't look right. What if
        people think we're awkward or have a bad handshake? What if
        we're evaluated poorly compared to others? With all this comes the
        behavioral manifestations - shaky hands, getting queasy,
        sweating - that ratchet the anxiety up even further. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/smarter-living/7-successful-people-dish-on-their-worst-job-interviews-and-what-they-learned.html">Read more</a>
